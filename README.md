# frikadel

## Background
You are one of the select few chosen to help us on our **secret mission**. Our mission will answer **the one question** looming on every Dutch persons mind. It will reveal one of **humanities best kept secrets**. 

**What is a Frikandel made out of?** 

We got our hands on the repository of **Big Frikandel**. In here we spotted a recipy decoder, and using our insane hacker skill we managed to open it using:
```
python recipy_decoder.py
```

But we ran into a problem. The decoder is protected by a password.
Here you come in. Using your git skills you might be able to find vulnerabilities left in the repo by Big Frikandel's bad practices.

## Assignment
1. **Create your own branch**, so your fellow hackers can work undisturbed
2. **Find the password**
3. **Save the recipe on your own branch**
4. **Share your results on main** so we can compare our findings and make sure Big Frikandel is not planting a red herring.
